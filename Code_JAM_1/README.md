First all what we need is data of students which can be collected by webscrapping and storing them with help of sqlite3 and then convert it into a csv file this step can be done only once ..
then we have other file which basically help to create a GUI and takes input from user of the reciever person for GUI see my image attached to it
it then sort out people having a certain blood group into other csv file from which we can send email to person in that list using function (send email)

blood group and name changes in mail as given by user......


stufftoPlot contains information of all students with there usermail and blood group

maillist contains A+ blood group people mail id ... here blood group changes as you can reciever's blood group
